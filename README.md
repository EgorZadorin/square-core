    <p>Flexible and Extensible Question Answering Platform</p>
</h3>

<!-- Introduction of SQuARE -->
SQuARE is a flexible and extensible Question Answering (QA) platform to enable users to easily implement, manage and share their custom QA pipelines (aka Skills in SQuARE).

Two ways are supported to use SQuARE:
1. üåê Get access to the existing QA Skills (and even deploy your Skill!) via our [demo page](https://square.ukp-lab.de/);
2. üíæ Or clone and install SQuARE to host services on a local machine.

## Why SQuARE?

Recent advances in NLP and information retrieval have given rise to a diverse set of question answering tasks that are of different formats (e.g., extractive, abstractive), require different model architectures (e.g., generative, discriminative) and setups (e.g., with or without retrieval). Despite having a large number of powerful, specialized QA pipelines (a.k.a., Skills) that consider a single domain, model or setup, there exists no framework where users can easily explore and compare such pipelines and can extend them according to their needs. 

To address this issue, we present SQuARE, an extensible online QA platform for researchers which allows users to query and analyze a large collection of modern Skills via a user-friendly web interface and integrated behavioural tests. In addition, QA researchers can develop, manage and share their custom Skills using our microservices that support a wide range of models (Transformers, Adapters, ONNX), datastores and retrieval techniques (e.g., sparse and dense).

Find out more about the project on [UKPs Website](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_ukp/ukp_research_projects/ukp_project_square/ukp_project_square_details.en.jsp).  

## Get Started
üëâ If you want to use the SQuARE public service online, you can refer to [Online Service](#Online-Service) for using the existing skills and refer to 
[Add New Skills](#Add-New-Skills) for adding new skills.

üëâ If you want to deploy SQuARE locally yourself, please refer to [Local Installation](#Local-Installation).

üëâ For illustration of the architecture, please refer to [Architecture](#Architecture).

üëâ And welcome to [contact us](#Contact).

## Online Service
Try out the on-the-go skills on the [demo page](https://square.ukp-lab.de/)! The existing skills include span-extraction, abstractive, multi-choice QA with contexts or without contexts (open QA based on retrieval).

## Add New Skills

### Step 1: Hosting New Skills
- If you want to add new skills to the [public service](https://square.ukp-lab.de/), please follow the skill-package examples (e.g. [skills/qa-retrieve-span-skill](skills/qa-retrieve-span-skill)) and submit yours via a [pull request](https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-core/pulls). We will make it run after code review;
- It is also OK to host the skill yourself somewhere else. The only thing that matters here is to provide a URL and also match the argument formats.

### Step 2: Register the Skill
Go to your user profile and click on "My Skills" and "New" buttons. Fill out the form and link it to the hosted skills:

## Local Installation
### Requirements
To run UKP-SQuARE locally, you need the following tools:
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
* [ytt](https://carvel.dev/ytt/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

### Install
We provide an installation script that takes care of the entire setup for you. After installing the previous [requirements](#requirements), simply run:
```bash
bash install.sh
```
### Run 
Finally, you can run the full system with docker-compose.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Check with `docker-compose logs -f` if all systems have started successfully. Once they are up and running go to [square.ukp-lab.local](https://square.ukp-lab.local).

### Add Skills
Add Skills according to the [Add New Skills](#Add-New-Skills) section. Note that, for open-domain skills the datastore need to created first.

## Architecture
For a whole (open QA) skill pipeline, it requires 6 steps:
1. First a user selects a Skill and issues a query via the user interface;
2. The selected QA Skill forwards the query to the respective Datastore for document retrieval;
3. The Datastore gets the query embedding from the Models, uses it for semantic document retrieval and returns the top documents to the Skill;
4. The Skill sends the query and retrieved documents to the reader model for answer extraction;
5. Finally, the answers are shown to the user;
6. Optionally, the user can view the results of the predefined behavioural tests for the Skill.
