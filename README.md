# square-core
Frontend and QA backend server code

# Overview
## Core features:
- Questions answering using a pretrained model with no training needed
- Advanced question answering using automatic skill selector, which predicts the best skill that can answer the question
- Provides an overview of your skills and skills that were published by other users
- Develop your own skill and publish on square
- Register, publish, unpublish retrain and delete your skills

## Quick Demo: 
To start Square, you can start a with docker-compose
1. Install docker and docker-compose
2. Clone Square repository from github
`git clone https://github.com/UKPLab/square-core.git`
3. Launch demo app
`cd square`
`docker-compose up  --build`

## Basic Workflow: 
1. Launch demo app
2. Create a sample skill and launch 
3.  Register your sample skill 
4. Choose your sample skill to answer the question 

## For developers
### Run locally (development)
The README.md in square-backend, square-frontend and reference-skill-example describes how to start the server locally for development.

### Run Skill on a remote server and â–¡-core locally
1. Login to the remote server
2. Get IP of the node with `ifconfig`
3. Start the webserver of the skill
4. On you local machine, create a tunnel to the remote with `ssh -L 5003:$IP:5003 $USERNAME@$HOST` (Note you might need to change the port 5003 to whatever port you are running the skill webserver on).
5. Assert that you can reach the skill from you local machine, e.g. by querying the /ping endpoint. `curl localhost:5003/api/ping`
6. Run square-core with docker-compose
   `docker-compose up`
7. Goto http://localhost and register or login
8. Create a new skill, as URL enter `http://host.docker.internal:5003/api` (Note that currently the form will say the skill is not available, this is a [bug](https://github.com/UKPLab/square-core/issues/8))
9. Go back to home and try your skill.

### Docker-Compose
Run `docker-compose up [--build]` to run front- and backend along with a Postgres DB in production mode.
This starts no additional skill server.

[docker-compose-skill.yaml](docker-compose-skill.yaml) gives an example on how to add skill server to the cluster.
However, skill server can also be run independently from the core server.  
If a skill server is run in the same cluster, then its container name should be used as host and not 127.0.0.1.
The client will say it is not available, but the backend server can resolve it.
