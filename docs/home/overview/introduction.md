# Introduction

SQuARE is an **open-source** QA platform that enables researchers and developers to:

- Use *QA Skills* in a web browser without writing any code. A *QA Skill* or simply *Skill* is a QA pipeline, i.e., a datastore, a retrieval model, a reader model, and a data preprocessing and postprocessing steps. All components are optional, allowing maximum flexibility to the user.
- Study the strengths and weaknesses of existing *Skills* by comparing them in parallel 
  with a user-friendly interface.
- Analyze the exaplanability of the Skills through **Saliency Maps**.
- Investigate the robustness to **Adversarial Attacks**.
- Visualize **graphs** for *Skills* using graphs.
- Study the behavior of the *Skills* through [behavioral tests](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist).
- Combine multiple *Skills* with [Meta-Skills](../components/skills.md#combining-skills-meta-skills).

## Why SQuARE?

The recent explosion of Question Answering (QA) models and datasets is difficulting the holistic analysis of new research. Recent advances in NLP and information retrieval have given rise to a diverse set of question answering tasks that are of different formats (e.g., extractive, multiple-choice), require  different model architectures (e.g., generative, discriminative), and setups  (e.g., with or without retrieval). SQuARE aims to be an **entry-point to QA research** providing a platform to run models to simplify reproducibility, analysis and comparisons. In addition, this platforms also provides the first **ecosystem for QA research** with *explainability*, *adversarial attacks*, *behavioral tests*, and *graph visualizations*.
