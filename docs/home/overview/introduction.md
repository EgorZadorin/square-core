# Introduction

SQuARE is an **open-source** QA platform that enables researchers and developers to:

- Use *QA Skills* in a web browser without writing any code.
- Study the strengths and weaknesses of existing *QA Skills* by comparing them in parallel 
  with a user-friendly interface.
- Analyze the general behavior of QA Skills through [behavioral testing of NLP models](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist).


> **_NOTE:_**  To try out SQuARE directly, please visit the [SQuARE Website](https://square.ukp-lab.de/qa).

## Why SQuARE?

Recent advances in NLP and information retrieval have given rise to a diverse set of question
answering tasks that are of different formats (e.g., extractive, multiple-choice), require 
different model architectures (e.g., generative, discriminative), and setups 
(e.g., with or without retrieval). Despite having a large number of powerful, specialized QA 
pipelines (a.k.a., Skills) that consider a single domain, model, or setup, there is no 
framework where users can easily explore and compare such pipelines.

To address this issue, we present SQuARE, an online QA platform for researchers that 
allows to query and analyze a large collection of modern Skills via a user-friendly web 
interface and integrated behavioral tests.

## Architecture

![square-arch](../../static/img/square-arch.png)

SQuARE is composed of 5 modules:

- **Datastores**: contains the index of large collections of documents (e.g. Wikipedia, PubMed). These indexes can be for 
  traditional systems such as BM25 or new dense retrieval systems such as Facebookâ€™s DPR.
- **Models**: manages the three type of models used in SQuARE:
    - Embedding models for indexing documents.
    - Fine-tuned HuggingFace (HF) Transformer models for QA.
    - The backbone Transformer models for Adapters (e.g., bert-base-uncased)
- **Skills**: module defines a QA pipeline. There are two base pipelines depending on the input:
    - Machine Reading Comprehension (i.e., the input is a question and a document). In this case, 
      we can define how to use a fine-tuned HF Transformer for QA (e.g. [distilBERT for SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad)). or set the Adapter weights for a Transformer model (e.g. [SQuAD Adapter for RoBERTa](https://adapterhub.ml/adapters/AdapterHub/roberta-base-pf-squad/)).
    - Open-retrieval (a.k.a. open-domain; i.e., the input is only a question). In this case, we can define the model to retrieve documents and the consecutive steps as in the previous case.
- **User Interface**: allows the user to interact with the Skills.
- **Explainability**: uses [CheckList](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist) to conduct behavioral tests on the Skills. This allows to easily see biases of the Skills.
