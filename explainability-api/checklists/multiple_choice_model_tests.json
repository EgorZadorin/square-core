The baby had the right sort of rash (although it was only on the back of the knee and, after checking, nowhere else). It had a temperature, but was one of the happiest, most alert children I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. It just didn't seem as if it had meningitis, and trust me, I've seen a fair few children and adults with it so I have a pretty good idea what it looks like.\nThen, as in the past, I was left waiting for an ambulance.\nFor around 45 minutes.\nThere was no way I was going to be able to transport the patient in my car. It's just not equipped to carry such a small child. We don't have baby seats and as the family didn't have a car they didn't have one either.\nSo the family ended up phoning a friend to take them to the hospital. The ambulance turned up just as they were getting into their friend's car.\nAll I had going through my head was the potential newspaper headline 'No Ambulance For Baby Dying Of Killer Bug!'\nLater that night I went to a woman who was having an extremely painful miscarriage. There is nothing I can do for that on scene, the patient needs to be in hospital. Thankfully the ambulance wasn't too far behind me, but if I had been waiting on scene then it would have been a very awkward and distressing wait (again, because of the pain, it would have been impossible to transport her in my car).\nMore and more I'm looking at my watch as an ambulance fails to arrive. It's only a matter of time before I have someone die in front of me while waiting for an ambulance.\nSo, I'm seriously considering leaving the FRU and going back to work on an ambulance.

Halfway to the address, a private house, my screen was updated: 'Patient has taken cocaine.'\nI was met at the front door by a young male, stripped to the waist and obviously agitated. 'Comein, myribsfeelfunny, andmyshoulderbladedon'tfeelright.'\n'Slow down,' I said, taking his pulse - 110, a bit on the high side, but he was bouncing off the walls.\n'My ribs man! They don't feel right! Have a feel.' He then started running his hands up and down his chest. 'Have you fallen over? Been hit? Anything unusual happened?' I asked. 'No man - just feel them ... FEEL THEM!'\n'Look, you need to calm down,' I replied. 'I can't do anything while you are hopping all over the place.'\nHe started shouting, 'FEEL THEM! JUST FUCKIN' FEEL THEM!' He turned his back to me, indicating that I should feel his normal-looking ribs.\nA sudden wave of anger passed over me - it was all I could do to not punch him in the back. I examined his ribs; they felt perfectly normal to me.\n'There,' I said, 'your ribs are fine.' 'What about my shoulder blades man?'\n'Look, you've taken cocaine right? You are feeling paranoid, it's normal, just try to relax a little.'\n'WHAT ... ABOUT ... MY ... FUCKIN' ... SHOULDER BLADES!' He turned his back on me again. I gritted my teeth and grabbed his shoulder blades.\n'They are fine. Now. Sit. Down.' He sat down. Then he stood up, then he paced around the kitchen, then he did a few circuits of the sofa, then he sat down again, then he stood up and hopped around a bit. I was getting tired just watching him.\n'Look,' I said trying to calm him, and me, down, 'is this the first time you've taken cocaine?'\n'No man!'\n'OK, well if you want we can take you to the hospital, get you checked out if you'd like?'\n'NO!' he shouted.
