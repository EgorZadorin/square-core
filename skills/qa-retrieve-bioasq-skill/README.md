# QA Skill using Retrieval and Span Extraction
This skill first retrieves multiple relevant documents to a query with the Data API
and then uses a Squad2.0-trained adapter to extract an answer span from each document.

This skill is basically a clone of the [reference skill](../reference-skill-example) 
so its documentation applies for this skill, too.
